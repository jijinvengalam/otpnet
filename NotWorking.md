The most common reason why this doesn't work is because time is off. Even if the minutes match on your phone and computer - it may be seconds off. This will affect the time based OTP generation.

Do a time sync and try again. If you are in a virtual machine - update the hosts time because sometimes VM integration tools sync time from the host to the guests.
